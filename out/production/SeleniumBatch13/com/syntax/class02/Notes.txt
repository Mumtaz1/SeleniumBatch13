Selenium Class 2:

What is a WebElement?
-- Anything we see on the web page is considered to be a webelement
   e.g., buttons, textboxes, checkboxes, links

HTML?
    HyperText Markup Language

What is DOM?
--DOM stands for Document Object MModel. It is the browser's internal
  view of the webpage. Also called as Developer Tools or Dev Tools.
--Document --> a simple html document which represents the page we are inspecting.
--Object --> Any new line in HTML is considered to be an Object.
-- Model --> It is just a layout of the HTML.

Locators?
-- It is an address or a position of a webelement on the webpage.
-- It is used to locate or identify webelements on the webpage.

8 Locators:
- ID
- Name
- TagName
- xpath
- LinkText
- PartialLinkText
- CssSelectors
- ClassName

Why do we need so many locators?
-- Developers may not provide all the locators for all the elements.
-- Some locators may have duplicate values in different nodes (lines).
-- Some locators may not be applicable for the elements we are looking for
   e.g., linktext and partialLinktext are only used for links (anchor tags).
   "a" tag is also called an anchor tag.
   if 2 or more elements have same attributes and attribute values, then
   selenium will only interact with the first element it locates.
