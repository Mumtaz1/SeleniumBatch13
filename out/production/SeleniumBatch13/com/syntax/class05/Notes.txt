Handling checkboxes and radio buttons:
    - If you only have 1 checkbox or 1 radio button, you can just click on it.
    - If you have multiple choices, you can store them in a List and loop through them.

DropDowns:
    DropDowns is a menu which gives you the opportunity to select one or more options.

Types of DropDowns:
    - Single Select
    - Mulitple Select

Handling dropdowns:
    1. Click on dropdowns and click on option.
    2. Using Select class - in order to use Select class we need to make sure our dropdown
       has a Select tag.

Selecting an option from a dropdown can be done in 3 ways:
    1. by index
    2. by visible text
    3. by value

Whenever you interact with multiple elements we store them inside the container such s
List, Set, etc.

In order to deselect the option from dropdown:
    - Make sure the dropdown is multiple select
      deselectByValue()
      deselectByIndex()
      deselectByVisibleText()
      deselectAll()
