Selenium Class 6:

Alerts:
    Alert is a pop-up message. Alerts take a complete focus on our main page that we are on.
    We cannot proceed further until it is handled.

3 types of Alerts:
    1. Web based alerts / HTML alerts - we can simply inspect and perform needed actions
       e.g., Faceobok > click on create new acct > launches a popup.
    2. Javascript alert / browser alert - we can handle these alerts by using switchTo method
       and we cannot inspect the page.
    3. Windows based alerts - we cannot handle with Selenium e.g. when you are trying to choose
       files from your own system, it launches a window which we cannot handle in Selenium.
       Not windows OS, it is a window window.

Types of JavaScript (JS) alerts:
    1. Simple alerts - click OK.
    2. Confirmation alert - either click Cancel or OK.
    3. Prompt alert - enter the text and then click OK or we can simply cancel.

To handle JavaScript (JS) alerts we only have 4 methods:
    1. accept() - click OK
    2. dismiss() - click on Cancel
    3. getText()
    4. sendKeys()

Frames:
    Frame is a separate independent window in our webpage.
    Frames allow devs to represent multiple views on one page

3 ways to interact or to switch to a Frame:
    1. By Index
    2. By Name or id
    3. By WebElement

In alerts - switch to an alert manually and switch back automatically.
In frames - switch to frame manually and switch back to the main page manually as well.

Interview Question:
    How do you handle Alerts in Selenium?
    Ams = We handle alerts by using Alert interface.
