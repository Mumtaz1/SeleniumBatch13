Selenium Class 07:

Handling multiple windows (tabs):
    In order for us to handle multiple windows we will be using :
    1. getWindowHandle()
    2. getWindowHandles()

WindowHandle:
    Is a unique ID that holds the address of the window or a tab.
    It is approximately a 40 alphanumeric character ID.

The original page where you navigate will be called the parent handle.
The additional tabs opened afterwards will be called child handle.

Most of the time when you interact with links they will open a new tab or a window.

Synchronization:
    Is the process of bringing the speed of two or more components to the same level.
    In this case we are bringing our script and page load to the same speed level.

Thread.sleep() -- static wait / unconditional wait.

Types of Selenium waits:
    1. Implicit wait
    2. Explicit wait
    3. Fluent wait

Implicit wait:
    It tells the WebDriver to wait until a certain amount of time before throwing an exception.
    It will only be written once and will be applied to the whole session of the execution.
    We can say that Implicit wait is a global wait.

Implicit wait works with findElement() method.
Implicit wait is usually set for 20 seconds. If the element is found in any time between the given time,
the remaining time will be ignored and your script will move on to the next line or next step.

If the element is not found in a given time, ONLY then you will get an exception (Nos such element found).
